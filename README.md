## About the Project

This project was completed to fulfill the requirements for: **N-328: Data Visualization - Final Project**. It uses D3.js to create interactive, dynamic visualizations that make complex population data accessible and engaging.

### Visualizations Include:
- **Choropleth Map**: Displays population density and growth patterns by country over time, with interactive sliders and tooltips to explore year-by-year changes.
- **Area Chart**: Visualizes global population trends and growth rates over time, offering a macro-level perspective.

While this project focuses on population trends, it serves as a foundational step toward exploring other pressing global issues. Future iterations will examine:
- **Global CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions**
- **Renewable Energy Production Worldwide**

These follow-up projects aim to uncover the interconnected dynamics between population, resource demands, and sustainability.
